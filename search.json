    "text": "Why Spatial Analysis Matters\nModern sports are increasingly about space creation and control. Understanding these spatial concepts gives teams and analysts powerful tools to:\n\nDevelop more effective tactical strategies\nIdentify weaknesses in opposing team formations\nTrain players to better recognize spatial opportunities\nMake data-driven decisions during matches\n\n\n\nConvexhull\nImagine stretching a rubber band around your team’s defenders - that’s essentially what a Convex Hull shows us!\n\nThe colored shape that wraps around the outermost players\nHow this shape expands and contracts as players move\nThe total area the defense is effectively covering\n\nWhat This Tells Us: - How compact or spread out your defense is - The spaces attackers might exploit - How well your team maintains its defensive shape\n\n\n\nVoronoi\nEver wondered how much space each player “owns” on the field?\n\nEach player has their own “territory” shown by different colors\nThese territories constantly change as players move\nThe boundaries show where one player’s influence ends and another’s begins\n\nWhat This Tells Us: - Which team controls more of the field - Where there might be space to pass or move into - How well positioned players are relative to each other\nIt’s like each player has their own personal bubble, and these bubbles adjust in real-time based on everyone’s position."

    "text": "Welcome to Futbol Analytics\nHello everyone! I’m Tyler Zoucha, and I have had an extremely long and successful career in the Futbol industry. From my earliest steps to playing at the professional level in Spain and Portugal, the beautiful game has been my constant companion and has given me so much. Throughout my career, I’ve developed a deep understanding of Futbol knowledge and life knowledge, both on and off the pitch.\n\n\nUnderstanding Space in Futbol Analytics\nWelcome to our exploration of spatial awareness in sports analytics. This website focuses on advanced analytical techniques that help understand and leverage space in competitive sports, particularly focusing on two powerful concepts: Convex Hull and Voronoi diagrams.\n\n\nStatic Frame Analysis\nIn the static snapshot, we observe a critical moment frozen in time. a setup that would eventually lead to a scoring opportunity.\n\n\n\nDynamic Sequence\nThe animation brings this sequence to life, revealing how the static positions evolved into dynamic movement. Over these frames, we witness:\n\nThe initial tactical setup\nPlayer movements unfolding in real-time\nThe flow of play developing\nAnd a scoring opportunity"

    "text": "Breaking Down Defensive Formations with Convex Hull\nThe Convex Hull analysis provides a revolutionary way to understand how teams and players occupy and control space on the field. Imagine drawing a rubber band around a group of players – the shape it forms is the convex hull. This mathematical concept helps us:\n\nMeasure the effective defensive coverage area\nIdentify gaps in defensive formations\nAnalyze team compactness and expansion\nTrack how defensive shapes change throughout the game\n\nBy analyzing these patterns, teams can better understand their defensive positioning and identify opportunities to exploit opposing team formations.\n\n\nCreating Opportunities with Voronoi Diagrams\nVoronoi diagrams take spatial analysis to the next level by dividing the playing field into regions of influence. Each region represents the area where a player has the most control compared to all other players. This analysis helps in:\n\nUnderstanding player dominance in specific areas\nIdentifying optimal passing lanes\nRecognizing space creation opportunities\nAnalyzing territorial control during different phases of play\n\nThrough Voronoi analysis, we can quantify which team is controlling more valuable space and identify tactical adjustments to create better scoring opportunities.\n\n\nOur Approach\nThis website combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications, providing:\n\nDetailed explanations of spatial analysis concepts\nReal-game examples and case studies\nInteractive visualizations\nPractical tools and techniques for analysts and coaches\n\nWhether you’re a coach, analyst, or enthusiast, our goal is to help you better understand and apply these powerful spatial analysis concepts to enhance your game understanding and strategic planning."
